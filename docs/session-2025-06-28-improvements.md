# Development Session Summary - June 28, 2025

## Issues Identified & Improvements Implemented

### 1. **Tool Delegation Flag Passing Enhancement** ✅ COMPLETED
   - **Issue**: SMV's `TO:tool` delegation couldn't pass additional flags to delegated tools
   - **Example**: `smv clean . FOR:scripts TO:dsc --mini` failed with "unexpected argument '--mini'"
   - **Root Cause**: Route parsing only supported `TO:tool` syntax, not `TO:tool:args`
   - **Solution Implemented**:
     - Enhanced `Route::To` enum from `To(String)` to `To { tool: String, args: Vec<String> }`
     - Updated route parsing to handle `TO:tool:arg1,arg2` syntax
     - Modified delegation function to append user arguments after tool-specific ones
   - **New Syntax Supported**:
     ```bash
     smv clean . FOR:scripts TO:dsc:--mini          # Single flag
     smv clean . FOR:scripts TO:dsc:--mini,--paths  # Multiple flags
     smv clean . FOR:scripts TO:say:split_and_titlecase,--verbose
     ```

### 2. **DSC Bug Analysis** ✅ COMPLETED
   - **Context**: User reported "dsc may have a bug in it"
   - **Analysis Performed**: Comprehensive code review of DSC (Directory Statistics & Scanning) tool
   - **Critical Issues Found**:
     - Race conditions in multi-threaded work queue checking (`stats.rs:122-124`)
     - Infinite recursion potential with circular symlinks (`stats.rs:213-214`)
     - Silent I/O error handling that ignores disk failures
     - Memory management issues with unbounded buffer growth
     - Work stealing inefficiencies and busy-waiting patterns
   - **Status**: Analysis documented, fixes needed in future development cycle

## Features to Implement Next

### 3. **User-Configurable Search Templates** 🎯 HIGH PRIORITY
   - **Current Issue**: `FOR:scripts`, `FOR:media`, etc. are hardcoded in source code
   - **User Expectation**: `FOR:` should be a configurable search template system
   - **Current Hardcoded Groups**:
     ```rust
     FOR:scripts  → [sh, py, rb, pl, rs, js, ts, bash, zsh] + TYPE:file
     FOR:media    → [jpg, png, gif, webm, mp4, jpeg, webp, svg] + TYPE:file  
     FOR:notes    → [md] + TYPE:file
     FOR:configs  → [conf, ini, yaml, yml, toml, json, config, cfg] + TYPE:file
     FOR:projects → [src, build, docs, target, dist, bin] + TYPE:folder
     ```
   - **Proposed Design**:
     ```bash
     # Define custom search groups
     smv define FOR:my-scripts EXT:lua,go,php TYPE:file
     smv define FOR:my-media EXT:raw,tiff,bmp TYPE:file SIZE>1MB  
     smv define FOR:config-dirs NAME:config,.config,settings TYPE:folder
     
     # Use custom groups
     smv clean . FOR:my-scripts TO:dsc:--mini
     smv organize . FOR:my-media TO:dff
     ```
   - **Implementation Plan**:
     - Create config file system (`~/.config/smv/search-groups.yaml`)
     - Add `smv define` command for creating/managing groups
     - Modify `expand_semantic_groups()` to load from config + hardcoded defaults
     - Add validation for custom group definitions
     - Support both built-in and user-defined groups

### 4. **Enhanced Error Handling for Delegation**
   - **Issue**: Tool delegation errors aren't always clear to users
   - **Improvements Needed**:
     - Better error messages when delegated tools aren't installed
     - Validation of tool-specific arguments before delegation
     - Fallback behavior when delegation fails

### 5. **DSC Integration Improvements**
   - **Context**: SMV delegates to DSC for file discovery but could be more efficient
   - **Potential Enhancements**:
     - Direct DSC library integration instead of subprocess calls
     - Shared configuration between SMV and DSC for consistent behavior
     - Performance optimization for large directory scans

## Technical Debt & Code Quality

### 6. **Route Parsing Robustness**
   - Current implementation handles basic cases but needs edge case testing
   - Add comprehensive unit tests for `TO:tool:arg1,arg2` parsing
   - Handle malformed delegation syntax gracefully

### 7. **Configuration System Architecture**
   - Design unified configuration system for SMV
   - Support both YAML and TOML formats
   - Include validation and schema definition
   - Migration path for existing users

## Next Development Session Priorities

1. **Immediate**: Implement user-configurable search templates (`FOR:` enhancement)
2. **Short-term**: Add comprehensive delegation testing and error handling
3. **Medium-term**: Address critical DSC bugs identified in analysis
4. **Long-term**: Unified configuration system and direct DSC integration

## Files Modified This Session

- `/home/jwl/projects/projects/rust/cnp/smv/src/cnp_grammar.rs`
  - Enhanced `Route` enum structure
  - Updated route parsing logic for extended delegation syntax
- `/home/jwl/projects/projects/rust/cnp/smv/src/main.rs`  
  - Modified delegation function signature and argument handling
  - Added support for user-provided tool arguments

## Testing Performed

- ✅ Basic delegation: `smv clean . FOR:scripts TO:dsc`
- ✅ Extended delegation: `smv clean . FOR:scripts TO:dsc:--mini`
- ✅ Syntax parsing accepts comma-separated arguments
- ⚠️  Full integration testing pending (compilation issues during session)

## Notes for Future Sessions

- Build system had timeout issues during testing - investigate cargo performance
- Consider adding debug output for delegation argument parsing during development
- Document delegation syntax in README and man page once testing is complete
