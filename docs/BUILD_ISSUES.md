# SMV Build Issues and Workarounds

## Procedural Macro Compilation Issue

### Problem Description

When building SMV with nightly Rust, you may encounter the following error:

```
error: cannot produce proc-macro for `clap_derive v3.2.25` as the target `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` does not support these crate types
```

This error occurs when trying to compile the `clap_derive` crate, which is a procedural macro dependency of the `clap` crate used for command-line argument parsing. 

The issue arises despite the following conditions:
- Using a platform (x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu) that fully supports procedural macros
- Having the necessary Rust components installed (rust-std, rustc, cargo, etc.)
- Using a recent version of Rust (1.85+, nightly)

### Root Cause Analysis

This problem appears to be related to an unusual interaction between:
1. The specific Rust toolchain installation
2. The proc-macro compilation process
3. Potentially the host environment configuration

The exact cause remains unclear, as this issue doesn't match common known problems with proc-macro compilation. It may be due to:
- Corrupted Rust toolchain installation
- Missing system dependencies required for proc-macro compilation
- Environment variables or OS-specific limitations
- Unusual interaction between crate versions

### Workaround Implemented

To work around this issue, we've modified the project to:
1. Switch from clap's derive-based API to its builder-based API
2. Keep using the nightly Rust toolchain
3. Maintain the same functionality while avoiding proc-macro dependencies

This approach eliminates the need for procedural macros during compilation while preserving all the command-line argument parsing capabilities.

### Alternative Approaches (Not Implemented)

Other potential solutions that were considered:
1. Reinstalling the Rust toolchain
2. Modifying system libraries or environment variables
3. Using a different crate for command-line argument parsing
4. Building with a different target triple

### If You Encounter This Issue

If you encounter this issue when building from source:

1. Ensure you're using the nightly Rust toolchain:
   ```bash
   rustup default nightly
   ```

2. If the issue persists, try reinstalling the Rust toolchain:
   ```bash
   rustup update
   rustup toolchain install nightly --force
   ```

3. Check for any missing system dependencies related to compiler toolchains

4. The workaround implemented in this project should allow successful builds without requiring additional configuration
