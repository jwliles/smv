# SMV - Smart Move

> **‚ö†Ô∏è EARLY DEVELOPMENT**: This project is in early development and not yet ready for production use. Features described in this README are planned but may not be fully implemented yet.

SMV (Smart Move) is an enhanced `mv` command line utility for batch renaming and moving files with transformation capabilities. It provides powerful file renaming operations with preview mode, undo functionality, and an interactive REPL interface.

## üìã Overview

SMV enhances the standard `mv` command with powerful filename transformation capabilities:

- **Drop-in replacement** for the standard `mv` command
- **Transform filenames** to various formats (snake_case, camelCase, etc.)
- **Preview changes** before applying them
- **Undo operations** with built-in history management
- **Interactive mode** with a user-friendly REPL
- **Batch operations** with glob pattern support

## ‚ö° Quick Examples

```bash
# Standard move operation
smv source.txt destination/

# Transform filenames to snake_case
smv --snake "My Document.txt" "Another File.txt"
# Result: my_document.txt, another_file.txt

# Preview kebab-case transformation without applying
smv --kebab --preview *.pdf

# Apply PascalCase recursively to JS files
smv --pascal --recursive src/*.js
```

### üîç Example Scenarios

#### Basic Move Operations

```bash
# Move a file to a directory
smv document.txt archive/

# Move multiple files
smv file1.txt file2.txt backup/

# Rename a file
smv old-name.txt new-name.txt
```

#### Filename Transformations

```bash
# Clean up messy filenames
smv --clean "My File (1)!!.txt" "Test & Demo.pdf"
# Result: "My File 1.txt", "Test Demo.pdf"

# Convert to snake_case with preview
smv --snake --preview "UserData.json" "ConfigFile.yaml"
# Shows: "user_data.json", "config_file.yaml" (without renaming)

# Convert all .js files to PascalCase recursively
smv --pascal --recursive src/*.js
# All .js files in src/ and subdirectories will use PascalCase

# Only process specific extensions
smv --title --extensions jpg,png images/
# Only .jpg and .png files will be converted to Title Case
```

#### Advanced Filtering

```bash
# Rename all .txt files except those with "backup" in the name
smv --snake --exclude "backup" *.txt

# Process only image files recursively
smv --clean --extensions jpg,png,gif --recursive media/
```

### üíª Interactive Mode

Launch the interactive REPL with:

```bash
smv -i
```

This opens a command prompt where you can:

```
smv:/current/directory> help

Commands:
  preview <transform> <files>  - Show transformation without applying
  apply <transform> <files>    - Apply transformation
  rename <files> --options     - Interactive renaming wizard
  undo                         - Revert last operation
  cd <directory>               - Change directory
  ls [pattern]                 - List files
  help                         - Show this help
  quit                         - Exit program

Transformations:
  clean, snake, kebab, title, camel, pascal, lower, upper
```

#### Interactive Examples

```
# Preview a transformation
smv:/home/user> preview snake *.txt
Preview: "File Name.txt" ‚Üí "file_name.txt"

# Apply a transformation
smv:/home/user> apply pascal *.js
Renamed: "user-model.js" ‚Üí "UserModel.js"

# Start interactive renaming wizard
smv:/home/user> rename *.jpg
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

### Backups

SMV automatically creates backups in `~/.config/smv/backups/`, enabling the undo functionality to work even after the program has been closed and reopened.

### Conflict Detection

SMV will not overwrite existing files unless explicitly instructed to do so, preventing accidental data loss.

## üîÆ Current Status & Roadmap

### Currently Implemented Features

- Basic `mv`-like functionality for moving files
- Filename transformations (snake_case, kebab-case, etc.)
- Preview mode to see changes before applying
- Interactive mode with REPL interface
- History tracking for undo support

### In Active Development (Next Release)

- **Transform Pipelines**: Chain multiple transformations
  ```bash
  smv -p "clean,snake,rep:space:_" file.txt
  ```
- **Enhanced Character Replacement**: Advanced pattern matching
  ```bash
  smv -R "old:new" file.txt
  smv -C "digits:X" file*.txt
  ```
- **Custom Transformations**: Save your own transformations
  ```bash
  smv --save "my-format:clean,snake,upper"
  smv -t my-format file.txt
  ```
