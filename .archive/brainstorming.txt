3. NEW PROPOSED FEATURES                                        *smv-proposed*

Character and Pattern Manipulation~
    Advanced character replacement:
    • Replace specific characters or substrings within filenames
    • Find and replace: Replace specific substrings (e.g., "fil" → "")
    • Pattern-based replacement: Replace conditionally (e.g., only at start)
    • Character class operations: Replace digits, vowels, consonants, etc.

Flexible Pattern Matching~
    • Wildcard matching beyond basic glob patterns
    • Simplified regex-like syntax for non-technical users
    • Character classes: Target specific types of characters

Transformation Pipeline Enhancements~
    • Sequential transformations with clear visualization
    • Save and load transformation sequences
    • Named transformation templates for reuse

Interactive Features~
    • Real-time preview as transformations are defined
    • Step-by-step application of transformations
    • Visual display of intermediate results

Smart Formatting~
    • Date format conversion (e.g., YYYYMMDD → YYYY-MM-DD)
    • Version number standardization
    • Smart numbering for sequential files (01, 02, 03...)
    • Automatic handling of filename collisions with intelligent strategies

Conditional Rules~
    • If-then-else conditions for transformations
    • Apply transforms only when filenames meet specific criteria
    • Different rules for different file types

User Experience Improvements~
    • Enhanced tab completion with context awareness
    • History browsing of previous transformations
    • Undo specific steps within a transformation sequence
    • Dry run with detailed explanation of each change

Integration Capabilities~
    • Git-aware operations: Skip files in .gitignore
    • Directory synchronization: Mirror rename operations across directories
    • Backup integration: Automatic backups before batch operations
    • Cloud service hooks: Rename local files and update cloud references

Advanced Batch Operations~
    • Batch rename with numbering
    • Sort and rename based on metadata (creation date, size, etc.)
    • Extract metadata from files for naming (e.g., EXIF data)
    • Apply transformations based on file content patterns

4. TODAY'S IDEAS & REFINEMENTS                                    *smv-today*

Transform Pipelines~
    • Command-line pipeline syntax for chaining transformations:
      >
          smv --pipeline "clean,snake,replace:old:new" file.txt
      <
    • Pipeline visualization showing each step's effect
    • Save and load common pipeline sequences with custom names

User-Defined Custom Transformations~
    • Create custom transformation functions:
      >
          smv --save-transform "my-format:clean,replace:space:_,upper" 
          smv --transform my-format file.txt
      <
    • Configuration file to store and manage custom transformations
    • Ability to share transformations with other users

Templating System~
    • Predefined templates for common use cases:
      >
          smv --template "podcast-episode" *.mp3
      <
    • Context-aware templates (different for images vs. documents)
    • Template variables (e.g., ${index}, ${date}, ${parent_dir})

Enhanced Character Replacement~
    • Character set transformations:
      >
          smv --replace-chars "digits:X" file*.txt
          smv --replace-chars "vowels:#" file*.txt
      <
    • Position-based replacements (beginning, end, position N)
    • Contextual replacements (only when surrounded by specific characters)

Conditional Transformations~
    • Rule-based transforms with simple syntax:
      >
          smv --rule "if:contains:draft:then:prefix:DRAFT-" *.txt
      <
    • Multiple conditions and actions with Boolean operators
    • File property conditions (size, date, permissions)

Structured Data Handling~
    • Smart date format conversion:
      >
          smv --date-format "YYYYMMDD:YYYY-MM-DD" *
      <
    • Extract and reformat version numbers
    • Handle structured data within filenames (ISBN numbers, coordinates)

REPL Enhancements~
    • Improved tab completion with context awareness
    • Live preview of transformations as commands are typed
    • Visual history browser with ability to reapply previous commands

==============================================================================
5. IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITIZATION                              *smv-priorities*

Priority Order:~
    1. Transform pipelines (builds on existing architecture)
    2. Enhanced character replacement (most requested feature)
    3. Custom transformations (user empowerment)
    4. Templating system (productivity boost)
    5. Conditional transformations (advanced flexibility)

Architecture Considerations:~
    • Plugin system to allow modular feature addition
    • Consistent API for all transformation types
    • Separation of transformation logic from UI/CLI
    • Flexible serialization format for saving/sharing transformations
