## Feature Prioritization

1. **Transform Pipelines**
   - Highest priority due to foundational architecture changes
   - Enables future features by establishing component system

2. **Enhanced Character Replacement**
   - Most requested user capability
   - Addresses common renaming use cases

3. **Custom Transformations**
   - Enables user extensibility
   - Foundation for template system

4. **Templating System**
   - Productivity enhancement for common workflows
   - Builds on custom transformation foundation

5. **Conditional Transformations**
   - Advanced functionality for power users
   - Requires other systems to be in place first

## Post-1.0 Considerations

- GUI interface development
- Remote file system integration
- Cloud service connectors
- Machine learning-based suggestions
- Community template repository
